    "text": "This project explores two different datasets. The main dataset is the social scientists who testified before congress from 1946-2016(with a slight update from 2016), the hearings they testified at, and the characteristics of those hearings, such as the congressional committees that convened them. This dataset was collected with the support NSF grant by Charles Seguin, Thomas V. Maher, and Yongjun Zhang and published on July 19, 2022.\nFor the other dataset. I couldn’t find a dataset that has a breakdown of each congress by party and year. But I found a table containing this information on the History, Art & Archives of the US House of Representatives. So I scrapped the website and turned it into a dataset with the help of BeautifulSoup API.\n\n\n\n\nSocial scientists congressional testimony.\nParty Divisions of the House of Representatives, 1789 to Present.\n\n\n\n\nSince the beginning of Covid-19, science and scientists have faced a lot of distrust and attacks from the public and even congress. I was curious to see if congress has historically relied on experience and guidance of experts for help or not. Specifically, during times of crises like the financial crises of 2008 or the stagflation of the 1980s, 2001 terrorist wether congress would ask for help from social scientists and questions when necessary and rely on their judgment and guidance. I also wanted to see whether our government relies more on the help of experts compared to the past(have we become more science and data-driven).\n\n\n\n\nWhat type of social scientists does congress mostly invite for testiomny?\nHas the number of social scientists appearning before congress increased?\nAre there any patterns between crises and number of scientists appearning between congress?\nDoes congress being dominated by republicans or democrates effect the number of social scientists appearning before congress?\nWhat type of social scientists appear the most?\n\n\npip
